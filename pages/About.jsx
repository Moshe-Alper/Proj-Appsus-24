        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <h3>Slava (Mail)</h3>
        <p>I'm Slava, and I'm working on the <strong>Google Mail Clone</strong>, part of Appsus. My focus is to provide an intuitive and clean email management system where you can send, receive, and organize emails seamlessly. Inspired by Google Mail, this app helps keep your inbox under control, offering essential features that make communication efficient and stress-free.</p>

        <h3>Moshik (Keep)</h3>
        <p>I'm Moshik, and I'm building the <strong>Note Keep Clone</strong>—an app designed to help you organize your thoughts, tasks, and ideas in one convenient place. Whether you want to jot down a quick note, create to-do lists, or save inspiration for later, this app is built with usability and simplicity in mind, just like Google Keep!</p>
